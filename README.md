# Breakout

This project is a recreation of a hit retro game called Breakout. Created in 1976, many people, enthusiast or not, will know what this game is. Using Unity, I recreated it for the purpose of creating my portfolio.

## Installation

If you want to play the game, you can download the zip file and extract it. No executable files as I am still learning on how to create one. I'll update this once I learn how to do it. For now, I can send an Google Drive link if you want to play it.

## Usage

The controls are simple. Either A or D key or the left and right arrows keys to move horizontally. Press Esc to pause the game.

## Features

There is no outstanding feature in this as this is merely a recreation of the retro game.

## Credits

I would like to thank Brackeys as his tutorials helped me a ton for this project. I also would like to thank the creators of sfxr for the free sound effects.
