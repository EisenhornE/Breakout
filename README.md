# Breakout

This project is a recreation of a hit retro game called Breakout. Created in 1976, many people, enthusiasts or not, will know what this game is. Using Unity, I recreated it for the purpose of creating my portfolio.

## Installation

No Need to install. Head to this link to play the game: https://simmer.io/@eisenhorn/breakout
I first thought of learning how to create executable files but I'd rather move on now and sending ZIP files to others might make me look suspicious

## Usage

The controls are simple. Either A or D key or the left and right arrow keys to move horizontally. Press Esc to pause the game.

## Features

There is no outstanding feature in this as this is merely a recreation of the retro game.

## Credits

I would like to thank Brackeys as his tutorials helped me a ton with this project. I also would like to thank the creators of sfxr for the free sound effects.
